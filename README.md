# CheatSheet

## Github
### Common commands
`git add .`
- Will add all items in the current directory to the commit

`git commit`
- Will commit everything added (if extension is added a screen will pop up where you can add the message)

`git push origin main`
- Pushes everything

`git branch <branch_name>` 
- Make a new branch

`git checkout <branch_name>`
- Changes to branch

`git checkout -b <branch_name>`
- Does the two above at the same time. So it will create a new branch and change to it

`git merge <branch_name>`
- Take the changes committed in <branch_name> and add them to the branch that you're currently on (you will need to do a `git checkout main` to the branch you want to merge INTO first)

`git branch -d <branch_name>`
- Delete the branch if it's already been merged into main

### Steps for creating new repo and opening it
1. Create a new repo for project on GitHub
2. clone into local machine
3. `cd` into newly create clone
